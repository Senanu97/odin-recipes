        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
        <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>

    <h3>How to prepare</h3>
    <!--Now, I will be trying to center an ordered list-->
    <ol class="ribolist">
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
        <p>Using paper towels, pat both sides of the dry steak;
            season generously with 11/4 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
        </p>
       
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
        <p>Heat a medium cast iron skillet over medium high heat until very hot,
            about 1-2 minutes; add canola oil.  
        </p>
       
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
        <p>Place the steak in the middle of the skillet and cook, turning every 2-3 minutes, 
            until a dark crust has formed on both sides, about 12-14 minutes.
        </p>
        
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
        <p>Reduce heat to medium low. Push steak to one side of the skillet; add butter, garlic, thyme and rosemary to opposite side of the skillet, 
            tilting the skillet towards the butter and cooking until butter is foaming, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.
        </p>
        
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>
        <p>Working carefully, spoon butter over steak for 1-2 minutes, turning over once, until it reaches an internal temperature of 120 degrees F for medium rare, 
            or until desired doneness. Let rest 15 minutes before slicing.
        </p>
        
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong></li>
        <p>Serve immediately.</p>
    </ol>
